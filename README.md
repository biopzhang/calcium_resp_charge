# calcium_resp_chargeThis project investigate electrastic interactions between calcium, protein, and water.The atomic charges of calcium in various protein environment in aqueous solution are determined using RESP/iRESP charge fitting protocol according to the molecular electrostaticpotential (MEP) generated by Gaussian.
