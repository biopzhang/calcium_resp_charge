# calcium_resp_charge

This project investigates electrastic interactions between calcium, protein, and water. 

The atomic charges of calcium in various protein environment in aqueous solution are determined using RESP/iRESP charge fitting protocol according to the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) generated by Gaussian.
