  Amber 10/11 i_RESP demo: 2 stage fit on 3 conformations with polarization 
 
convert the GAUSSIAN output for i-resp:
# atoms:   172 # esp: 27950
generating the input for i-resp stage 1:
there are a total of 172 atoms
1 water molecules
generating initial charge file:
A total of 172 atoms and 1 water.
