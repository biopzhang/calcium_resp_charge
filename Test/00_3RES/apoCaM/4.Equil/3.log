Command line:
  gmx grompp -f nvt-pr-md-50.mdp -c nvt-pr-start.gro -p apoCaM-CA.top -o nvt-pr.tpr


NOTE 1 [file nvt-pr-md-50.mdp, line 61]:
  nvt-pr-md-50.mdp did not specify a value for the .mdp option
  "cutoff-scheme". Probably it was first intended for use with GROMACS
  before 4.6. In 4.6, the Verlet scheme was introduced, but the group
  scheme was still the default. The default is now the Verlet scheme, so
  you will observe different behaviour.


Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.4#

NOTE 2 [file nvt-pr-md-50.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

2 GPUs user-selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 PP ranks in this node: 0,1


NOTE: GROMACS was configured without NVML support hence it can not exploit
      application clocks of the detected Quadro M4000 GPU to improve performance.
      Recompile with the NVML library (compatible with the driver used) or set application clocks manually.


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin thread to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).


NOTE: Thread affinity setting failed. This can cause performance degradation.
      If you think your settings are correct, ask on the gmx-users list.

NOTE 1 [file nvt-pr-md-100.mdp, line 61]:
  nvt-pr-md-100.mdp did not specify a value for the .mdp option
  "cutoff-scheme". Probably it was first intended for use with GROMACS
  before 4.6. In 4.6, the Verlet scheme was introduced, but the group
  scheme was still the default. The default is now the Verlet scheme, so
  you will observe different behaviour.


Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.5#

NOTE 2 [file nvt-pr-md-100.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

2 GPUs user-selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 PP ranks in this node: 0,1


NOTE: GROMACS was configured without NVML support hence it can not exploit
      application clocks of the detected Quadro M4000 GPU to improve performance.
      Recompile with the NVML library (compatible with the driver used) or set application clocks manually.


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin thread to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).


NOTE: Thread affinity setting failed. This can cause performance degradation.
      If you think your settings are correct, ask on the gmx-users list.

Command line:
  gmx grompp -f nvt-pr-md-150.mdp -c nvt-pr-start.gro -p apoCaM-CA.top -o nvt-pr.tpr


NOTE 1 [file nvt-pr-md-150.mdp, line 61]:
  nvt-pr-md-150.mdp did not specify a value for the .mdp option
  "cutoff-scheme". Probably it was first intended for use with GROMACS
  before 4.6. In 4.6, the Verlet scheme was introduced, but the group
  scheme was still the default. The default is now the Verlet scheme, so
  you will observe different behaviour.


Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.6#

NOTE 2 [file nvt-pr-md-150.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

2 GPUs user-selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 PP ranks in this node: 0,1


NOTE: GROMACS was configured without NVML support hence it can not exploit
      application clocks of the detected Quadro M4000 GPU to improve performance.
      Recompile with the NVML library (compatible with the driver used) or set application clocks manually.


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin thread to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).


NOTE: Thread affinity setting failed. This can cause performance degradation.
      If you think your settings are correct, ask on the gmx-users list.

NOTE 1 [file nvt-pr-md-200.mdp, line 61]:
  nvt-pr-md-200.mdp did not specify a value for the .mdp option
  "cutoff-scheme". Probably it was first intended for use with GROMACS
  before 4.6. In 4.6, the Verlet scheme was introduced, but the group
  scheme was still the default. The default is now the Verlet scheme, so
  you will observe different behaviour.


Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.7#

NOTE 2 [file nvt-pr-md-200.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

2 GPUs user-selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 PP ranks in this node: 0,1


NOTE: GROMACS was configured without NVML support hence it can not exploit
      application clocks of the detected Quadro M4000 GPU to improve performance.
      Recompile with the NVML library (compatible with the driver used) or set application clocks manually.


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin thread to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).


NOTE: Thread affinity setting failed. This can cause performance degradation.
      If you think your settings are correct, ask on the gmx-users list.

Command line:
  gmx grompp -f nvt-pr-md-250.mdp -c nvt-pr-start.gro -p apoCaM-CA.top -o nvt-pr.tpr


NOTE 1 [file nvt-pr-md-250.mdp, line 61]:
  nvt-pr-md-250.mdp did not specify a value for the .mdp option
  "cutoff-scheme". Probably it was first intended for use with GROMACS
  before 4.6. In 4.6, the Verlet scheme was introduced, but the group
  scheme was still the default. The default is now the Verlet scheme, so
  you will observe different behaviour.


Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.8#

NOTE 2 [file nvt-pr-md-250.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

2 GPUs user-selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 PP ranks in this node: 0,1


NOTE: GROMACS was configured without NVML support hence it can not exploit
      application clocks of the detected Quadro M4000 GPU to improve performance.
      Recompile with the NVML library (compatible with the driver used) or set application clocks manually.


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin thread to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).


NOTE: Thread affinity setting failed. This can cause performance degradation.
      If you think your settings are correct, ask on the gmx-users list.

NOTE 1 [file nvt-pr-md-300.mdp, line 61]:
  nvt-pr-md-300.mdp did not specify a value for the .mdp option
  "cutoff-scheme". Probably it was first intended for use with GROMACS
  before 4.6. In 4.6, the Verlet scheme was introduced, but the group
  scheme was still the default. The default is now the Verlet scheme, so
  you will observe different behaviour.


Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.9#

NOTE 2 [file nvt-pr-md-300.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

2 GPUs user-selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 PP ranks in this node: 0,1


NOTE: GROMACS was configured without NVML support hence it can not exploit
      application clocks of the detected Quadro M4000 GPU to improve performance.
      Recompile with the NVML library (compatible with the driver used) or set application clocks manually.


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin thread to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).


NOTE: Thread affinity setting failed. This can cause performance degradation.
      If you think your settings are correct, ask on the gmx-users list.

Command line:
  gmx grompp -f npt-pr-md.mdp -c nvt-pr.gro -t nvt-pr.cpt -p apoCaM-CA.top -o npt-pr.tpr


NOTE 1 [file npt-pr-md.mdp, line 63]:
  npt-pr-md.mdp did not specify a value for the .mdp option
  "cutoff-scheme". Probably it was first intended for use with GROMACS
  before 4.6. In 4.6, the Verlet scheme was introduced, but the group
  scheme was still the default. The default is now the Verlet scheme, so
  you will observe different behaviour.


Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.10#

NOTE 2 [file npt-pr-md.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

Using 3 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

2 GPUs user-selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 PP ranks in this node: 0,1


NOTE: GROMACS was configured without NVML support hence it can not exploit
      application clocks of the detected Quadro M4000 GPU to improve performance.
      Recompile with the NVML library (compatible with the driver used) or set application clocks manually.


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin thread to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).


NOTE: Thread affinity setting failed. This can cause performance degradation.
      If you think your settings are correct, ask on the gmx-users list.
