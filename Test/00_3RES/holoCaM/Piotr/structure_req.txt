1. Is it possible to left in the system only two asps and 1 glu?

2. Instead of AA backbone â€“ replace C-alpha by CH3 groups in them

   We can think about fixing the position of those CH3 groups (or only C atoms in them)

   and then optimize the rest.

3. Add one water molecule close to Ca2+ ion in that complex?

   Probably, with oxygen reoriented towards Ca2+, and located at some distance 2.0-3.0A.
