It seems that strategy would be:

1) to prepare some number of configuration of the system;

2) then try to run some clustering of those geometries, to understand the diversity of configuration states.

   it could be done in terms of couple of distances (oxygens-Ca2+) and angles and dihedrals (between some selected subsets of group of atoms);

3) then select representative members of those clusters;

4) then run single point QM calculations with generating ESPs;

5) then do i_resp charge fitting; and

6) then using those geometrical parameters and charges design the machine learning stuff.


But at the end, all of that seems to me to lead to some kind of look-up method. That means when we run molecular dynamics for a specific geometry of the loops

we will have this and that set of atomic charges (and induced dipoles) derived from machine learning, instead of using continuous calculation of induced dipoles

for consensus set of charges, which had been derived from multimolecular i_resp fitting. This is because in machine learning we already deal with a set of i_resp

    charges (and possibly induced dipoles?) for a set of representative configurations and it seems that all of those parameters will be precomputed.

    Given that - I don't understand right now what we want to achieve with this machine learning.
